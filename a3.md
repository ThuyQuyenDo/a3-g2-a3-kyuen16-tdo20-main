## Reflection for Ka Chun Yuen

1. Please detail what exactly **you** did for the assignment.
In this assignment, i implemented Part A MinHeap and decide the related Prim’s algorithm.

Overview for this assignment:

Environment Set Up:

In order to finish the question in this assignment, i have followed the instruction about building required environment, for instance, pulling the old files from the previous assignment such as “a2d.py”. 

Min Heap Implementation:

- The MinHeap class was defined to represent the heap data structure.
- An optional input array could be provided during initialization, with each element added to the heap and the float-up method called to maintain the heap property.
- The insert method added a new element to the end of the heap list and then called float-up on the index of the new element to maintain the heap property.

Firstly, I implemented a Min Heap data structure which is a complete binary tree where each node is smaller than its children. The implementation involved defining the Heap class with methods for inserting elements into the heap, extracting the minimum element from the heap, and maintaining the heap property after each operation. I used an array-based implementation for the heap.

Prim's Algorithm:
Next, I implemented Prim's algorithm using the Min Heap data structure to find the minimum spanning tree of a weighted undirected graph. The implementation involved creating a Graph class with methods for adding edges to the graph, initializing the heap with the edges of the graph, and repeatedly extracting the minimum-weight edge from the heap and adding it to the minimum spanning tree until all vertices were included. I used an adjacency list representation for the graph.

To conclude, I was able to construct Prim's approach for locating the minimal spanning tree of a weighted undirected graph using the Min Heap data structure. In order to carry out the implementation, a Graph class was created, the heap was initialised with the edges of the graph, and repeatedly the smallest-weight edge was taken out of the heap and added to the minimal spanning tree until all vertices were covered.


2. What was one thing **you** learned when doing this assignment?

I have learned what is minimum spanning tree. The below are the notes i study for minimum spanning tree:

Minimum Spanning Trees 

Trees are undirected graphs:

Tree are a special undirected graphs, but undirected graphs might not be a Tree

- Trees do not have cycles

Trees are connected graphs

definition of trees:

******************************************************************************************Trees are connected acyclic undirected graphs******************************************************************************************

 If a tree has n vertices, then it has **n-1 edges**

- Less than n-1 edges → not trees
- More than n-1 edges → not trees

Input: A connected undirected graph with n vertices.

Find a subgraph ：

- Keep all the n vertices -
- Keep n-1 edges -
- The subgraph is connected -

Result: The subgraph is a spanning tree

LEFT： Spanning Tree 

Keep 6 edges, cause we have 7 nodes (7-1)

Subgraph must be a tree

No cycle

**Sum of weights: 21**

- Spanning trees are not unique

A graph may not have spanning tree - 



3. What was its most challenging aspect and what did **you** do to overcome this challenge?

The most challenging aspect is using Prim’s algorithm to find out the minimum spanning tree, i have tried so many times and result in error and failure:
Here are the correct implementation for the Prim’s algorithm:

from a2d import Graph
from a3_parta import MinHeap

def minimum_spanning_tree(graph):
    mst = []
    visited = set()
    start_vertex = 0
    visited.add(start_vertex)
    edges = [
        (cost, start_vertex, to)
        for to, cost in graph.get_connected(start_vertex)
    ]
    heap = MinHeap(edges)

    while not heap.is_empty():
        cost, frm, to = heap.extract_min()
        if to not in visited:
            visited.add(to)
            mst.append((frm, to))
            for to_next, cost_next in graph.get_connected(to):
                if to_next not in visited:
                    heap.insert((cost_next, to, to_next))

    return mst
    
    
The most challenging aspect of implementing Prim's algorithm for me could be understanding the logic of the algorithm and figuring out the correct implementation steps.

 It involves working with different data structures like sets, lists, and heaps, which could add to the complexity.

To overcome this challenge, i need to have a clear understanding of the algorithm's logic and the data structures involved. One approach could be to go through the algorithm's pseudocode and try to understand each step's purpose. It would also help to review the data structures used in the algorithm and how they interact with each other.

## Reflection for Thuy Quyen Do

1. Please detail what exactly **you** did for the assignment.
 In this assignment , I completed part B Minimum Spanning Tree. We use the same Ka Chun github because it is easier for us to import all old files from the previous assignments. Additionally, Part B and C are also connected with part A. 
 
 The smallest spanning tree problem of the graph is one of the graph optimization problems that has many different applications in real life. To illustrate the algorithm, we refer to some typical practical models of the problem:
 - The problem of road construction: suppose we want to build a road system connecting n cities such that there is always a path between any cities. The problem is to find the center of the smallest spanning tree on the graph, each city to a vertex such that the total cost of road construction is minimized.
 - Computer networking problem: It is necessary to network a system of n computers numbered from 1 to n. Knowing the cost of connecting machine i to machine j is c[i,j], i,j = 1, 2, . . . ,n (usually this cost depends on the length of the connecting cable to be used). Find a way to network so that the total cost of networking is minimal.
 - Idea: incrementally load the vertices into the spanning tree. Each time select an unloaded vertex such that it is adjacent and closest to the loaded vertices.
2. What was one thing **you** learned when doing this assignment?
- Illustrative example: With a graph as shown, find the smallest spanning tree of the graph.

- Algorithm description: From the starting vertex, store the starting vertex in the set of considered vertices, save the length from one vertex to all other vertices (if there is a direct path). Considered vertex set: vertex 0

- Select the closest vertex to the considered vertex set (vertex 2), save this vertex in the set of considered vertices. Update the distance to the remaining vertices if the selected vertex has a smaller distance than the previously saved distance. Considered vertex set: vertex 0, vertex 2

- Stages in an Prim algorithm:

 + Keep two separate sets of vertices.
 + One of them having vertices in the expanding spanning tree and the other not having any such vertices.
 + Choose the least expensive vertex that is connected to the developing spanning tree but isn't already present in the growing spanning tree, and include it there.
 + Priority Queues can be used to accomplish this.
 + Add the developing spanning tree's connected vertices to the Priority Queue.
 + To accomplish this, mark the nodes that have already been chosen and only add the unmarked nodes to the Priority Queue. 

3. What was its most challenging aspect and what did **you** do to overcome this challenge?
I struggled with algorithm og Minimum Spaaning Tree. There are:
- In each iteration, we choose the edge with the least weight and put it in T.
- The selected edge introduced into T must not form a cycle with the edges already in T.
The first problem solved is to create a priority queue on the list of edges. However, it is possible to arrange the edges in ascending order of weights from the beginning.
To solve the second problem, at each step of the Kruskal algorithm, the set of vertices and edges introduced into T is not a tree, but only satisfies the non-cyclical code. Thus at each step T is a forest, T = . To examplify,
- Now consider an edge e = (u,v) of G that is not in T, there are 3 possibilities:
- Neither u,v is in T. Then if e is added to T, there is no cycle, but the edge e forms a new subtree.
- One vertex, for example, u is in T, and the other v is not in T. Adding edge e and vertex v to T (to the subtree containing vertex u) does not create a cycle.
- Both u and v are in T. Then
 + If u,v are in the same subtree Tk, we cannot add side e to T.
 + If u,v are in two different subtrees, it is possible to add edge e to T (two vertices u, v already in T do not need to be added, after adding two subtrees, they will merge into one tree.
